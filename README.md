# Date Fruits Classifier App

It is an ML-based app for Android, that aims to make the target user familiar with the types of date fruit. Up to now, the app can classify three types of date fruit (Ajwa, Sukkary Mofetil, and Rothana). Soon, it will support more types.

### Used Libraries and Technologies:
•	Tensorflow and Tensorflow Lite.\

### Used Data Set:
The [dataset](https://bit.ly/dataSetDates) was manually collected by my team (Maram Alshehri, Abeer Alzahrany, & Sara Alhadrami). It contains images of three types of date fruits. The images include different scenes such as an image that includes one date fruit, a group of date fruits, date fruits with white background, or on a plate.
